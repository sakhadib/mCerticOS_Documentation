#### Function: `kctx_new`

```c
unsigned int kctx_new(void *entry, unsigned int id, unsigned int quota)
{
    unsigned int child = alloc_mem_quota(id, quota);                              //* Allocate memory for the new child thread
    kctx_set_eip(child, entry);                                                   //* Set the eip of the thread states
    kctx_set_esp(child, (void *) &STACK_LOC[child][PAGESIZE]);                    //* Set the esp of the thread states

    return child;
}
```

* **Purpose**: Initializes a new kernel context for a child process by allocating resources, setting the `eip` (instruction pointer) to the entry point of the process, and setting the `esp` (stack pointer) to the top of the designated stack space in `STACK_LOC`.
* **Mechanism**:
  1. **Allocate Memory Quota**:
     * Calls `alloc_mem_quota(id, quota)` to designate memory resources for the new child process. The `alloc_mem_quota` function is responsible for allocating part of the parent processâ€™s quota to the child, and it returns the child process ID if successful.
     * If allocation fails (insufficient resources or quota), `alloc_mem_quota` will return `NUM_IDS`, signaling that the process could not be created.
  2. **Set Entry Point (EIP)**:
     * `kctx_set_eip(child, entry)` sets the `eip` (Extended Instruction Pointer) for the child process to the address of the `entry` function. This pointer represents where the CPU should begin executing for the new process.
  3. **Set Stack Pointer (ESP)**:
     * `kctx_set_esp(child, (void *) &STACK_LOC[child][PAGESIZE])` sets the `esp` (Extended Stack Pointer) to the top of the allocated stack for the child process. Since the stack grows downward, the stack pointer starts at the highest address in the stack space (`&STACK_LOC[child][PAGESIZE]`).
* **Return Value**:
  * If successful, `kctx_new` returns the child process ID, which identifies the new kernel context created.
  * In case of failure, it returns `NUM_IDS`, signaling an error in creating the child context (usually due to memory allocation issues).

#### Use Case

This function is critical for **creating new kernel threads** and initializing their execution context. By setting up the `eip` and `esp` for the child, it prepares the thread for execution, allowing the OS to manage multiple threads and processes effectively.
